# Nearest Common Ancestor

Write a program that finds the nearest common ancestor. The program should contain
a function that:

- Accepts a tree and two node pointers (not element values, but node pointers!)
- The function must return the closest common ancestor.

While implementing the program, you are allowed to use uni-directional binary trees only. It
means that you cannot have pointers to the parent elements.

Assume that the function input is given correctly and both node pointers belong to the tree.

The functionality implemented must be unit-tested.
